Hey there 👋

I’m a Computer Science graduate from Romania.
My main focus is full-stack development, but I’m also exploring different paths to see where I fit best.

Right now, I’m learning Java and Spring Boot, and working through the Open Source Society University curriculum to strengthen my foundations and gain hands-on experience.

This GitHub profile is mainly used for practice projects and learning experiments, where I try out new ideas, technologies, and concepts as I grow as a developer.
